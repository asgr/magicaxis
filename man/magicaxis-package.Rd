\title{
Pretty Scientific Plotting with Minor-Tick and Log Minor-Tick Support
}
\description{
Functions to make pretty axes (major and minor) on scientific plots. Particularly effort is made on producing nice log plot outputs. The core function produces pretty axis labelling in a number of circumstances that are often used in scientific plotting. There is a higher level interface to a generic plot function that will usually produce nice plots, even without much though on the users part.
